# Upgradable_AMMs

## Project Overview

Upgradable_AMMs is an innovative project that combines the power of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) with the flexibility of upgradable smart contracts. Inspired by Uniswap v2, this project aims to create a decentralized exchange platform that can evolve and improve over time without disrupting user funds or liquidity.

### Key Features

- Upgradable smart contracts for future-proofing the AMM
- Uniswap v2-inspired liquidity pools and swap mechanics
- Advanced Go backend for efficient off-chain processing and monitoring
- Hardhat for Ethereum development environment
- Gin web framework for building the API

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. `smart-contracts/`: Contains all Solidity smart contracts and Hardhat configuration
2. `backend/`: Houses the Go backend code using the Gin web framework

## Smart Contracts

Our smart contracts are built using Solidity and the OpenZeppelin library for upgradable contracts. The core components include:

- `UpgradeSwapFactory`: Manages the creation of liquidity pools
- `UpgradeSwapPair`: Handles individual liquidity pools and swap logic

These contracts are designed to be upgradable, allowing for future improvements and bug fixes without migrating liquidity.

## Backend

The Go backend serves several crucial functions:

- Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain to monitor and process events
- Provides a high-performance API for frontend applications
- Implements advanced features like real-time price updates and analytics

We use the Gin web framework for its excellent performance and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Hardhat and smart contract development)
- Go 1.16 or later
- Ethereum node access (e.g., Infura)
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Upgradable_AMMs.git
   cd Upgradable_AMMs
   ```

2. Set up the smart contracts:
   ```
   cd smart-contracts
   npm install
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. Set up the Go backend:
   ```
   cd ../backend
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Configure your environment variables (see `.env.example` in each directory)

### Running the Project

1. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```
   cd smart-contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

2. Start the Go backend:
   ```
   cd ../backend
   go run main.go
   ```
